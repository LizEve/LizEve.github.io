### Scripting Projects

Check out my [GitHub page](https://github.com/LizEve) for my coding projects. I pretty much taught myself how to code, so it is by no means professional or succienct. But, I enjoy it and I am always happy to answer questions and share tips or tricks. 

Non-dissertation related, I have been working with the [Shirley C. Tucker Herbarium](http://www.herbarium.lsu.edu/) and [Center for Computing and Technology](https://www.cct.lsu.edu/) to reconfigure their [digitization imaging workflow](https://github.com/LizEve/HerbariumRA). Our goal is to provide a flexible framework of scripts that are open source and accessible to non-professional coders(i.e. biologists who have taught themselves).
