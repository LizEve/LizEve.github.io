## About me
I am currently a PhD student at Louisiana State University, advised by [Dr. Jeremy Brown](https://phyleauxlab.github.io/genevieve.html) and [Dr. Chris Austin](https://sites01.lsu.edu/faculty/austinlab/).
My PhD research focuses on testing and developing methods to identify and quantify the variation in phylogenomic data. In particular I am interested in applying these methods to herpetological non-model systems that lack genomic resources to better understand their biology and natural history.
I got my Bachelor’s Degree from University of California Davis in 2010. Before starting my PhD I worked as a tech in [Brad Shaffer’s](https://sites.lifesci.ucla.edu/eeb-shafferlab/) lab at UC Davis and UCLA. As a tech I developed genomic resources for turtles and salamanders. Additionally I helped with fieldwork, managing a salamander colony, and general lab maintenance. Collecting and developing large genomic datasets sparked my interest in the variation and diversity in information content in current genomic datasets.
