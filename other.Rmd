I am a self-taught with everything coding and computer related. I started teaching myself bash and python the year before I started my PhD and found that I really enjoyed it.

### Herbarium Imaging Workflow



I worked with the [Shirley C. Tucker Herbarium](http://www.herbarium.lsu.edu/) and [Center for Computing and Technology](https://www.cct.lsu.edu/) to reconfigure their [digitization imaging workflow](https://github.com/LizEve/LSU_Herbarium_Imaging_Scripts), incorperating scripts from the [Consortium of Pacific Northwest Herbaria](https://www.pnwherbaria.org/documentation/specimenimaging.php). 

Our goal is to provide a flexible framework of scripts that are open source and accessible to non-professional coders(i.e. biologists who have taught themselves).
