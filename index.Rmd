## How does variation develop, how does it persist, and how do we know?

<br>
<br>

### I work on answering these questions in two main ways.

<br>
<br>

#### 1. By testing methods for quantifying variation.

<br>

#### 2. By studying morphological and genetic variation across multiple time scales in anurans and squamates.

<br>
<br>

##### I am currently an NSF post-doc at Utah State University, working on toad evolution with Dr. Womack, Utah State University, and Dr. Tarvin, University of California, Berkeley and Museum of Vertebrate Zoology.

#### Website is currently undergoing some alterations, so I am leaving my favorite poem here as I troubleshoot a few things. 

’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe.
<br>
<br>
“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
      The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
      The frumious Bandersnatch!”
<br>
<br>
He took his vorpal sword in hand;
      Long time the manxome foe he sought—
So rested he by the Tumtum tree
      And stood awhile in thought.
<br>
<br>
And, as in uffish thought he stood,
      The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
      And burbled as it came!
<br>
<br>
One, two! One, two! And through and through
      The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
      He went galumphing back.
<br>
<br>
“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
      Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”
      He chortled in his joy.
<br>
<br>
’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe.
