#### **Project - **Is the trill gone? How repeated loss of a sexually selected trait impacts the evolution of a speciose anuran family
I am investigating the loss of male advertisement calls and related morphological structures in True Toads (*Bufonidae*). Little is known about how the loss of sexually selected traits affects the evoluiton and diversification of a lineage. Vocal sacs in anurans (frogs and toads) are an ideal trait and study system to examine the loss of a sexually selected trait, because of the direct connection between morphology and advertisement calls, which are used to attract mates and guard territory.

I am working in [Dr. Molly Womack's](https://www.womacklab.com/team) lab at Utah State University and collaborating with [Dr. Rebecca Tarvin](https://www.tarvinlab.org/) at UC Berkeley.

## **PhD** 
### **Louisiana State University ** - 2014-2020 - <span style='font-size:20px;'>&#128047;</span> <span style="color: purple;">**Geaux **</span><span style="color:  darkgoldenrod;">**Tigers!!**</span> 
#### **Advisors:** <br>
[Dr. Jeremy Brown](https://phyleauxlab.github.io/genevieve.html) <br>
[Dr. Chris Austin](https://sites01.lsu.edu/faculty/austinlab/)

#### **Dissertation - **Quantifying Structure and Variation in Complex Phylogenetic Data

My PhD research focuses on testing and developing methods to identify and quantify the variation in phylogenomic data. In particular applying these methods to herpetological non-model systems that lack genomic resources to better understand their biology and natural history.

#### **Laboratory technician/manager - UC Davis & UCLA** - 2011-2014

Before starting my PhD I worked as a tech in [Brad Shafferâ€™s](https://sites.lifesci.ucla.edu/eeb-shafferlab/) lab at UC Davis and UCLA. As a tech I developed genomic resources for turtles and salamanders. Additionally I helped with fieldwork, managing a salamander colony, and general lab maintenance. Collecting and developing large genomic datasets sparked my interest in the variation and diversity in information content in current genomic datasets. 



#### **Noah's Bagels** - 2010
I was pretty burnt out after I graduated. I spent a few months working at a Noah's Bagels until I was tired of it and inspired to take the GRE. It did not take long. I am not cut out for customer service. Major respect for those who are.

#### **Bachelors - University of California Davis ** - 2006-2010

I participated in some amazing projects as an undergrad including helping to manage a pupfish colony for [Dr. Chris Martin](http://ib.berkeley.edu/labs/martin/) and feeding scrub jays for [Dr. Teresa Iglesias](https://teresaliglesias.com/).
